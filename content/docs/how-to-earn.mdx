## 1. Entry-Fee Matches

- **Strategy**: Start with low-stake rooms to build confidence and rating.

## 2. Tournaments

- **Scheduled events**: Join daily or weekly tournaments with larger prize pools.  
- **Leaderboard rewards**: Top 10 finishers get bonus airdrops of platform tokens.  

## 3. Daily Login Rewards

- **Free token drops** for simply logging in each day.  
- **Streak bonus**: 7-day streak gives you a rare NFT badge.

## 4. NFT Achievements

- **Earn badges** for milestones (e.g., 50 wins, 10-game unbeaten streak).  
- **Sell or trade** your badges on secondary marketplaces.

## 5. Referral Program

- **Invite friends** by sharing your referral link.  
- **Bonus**: 5% of their entry-fee earnings goes to you.

## 6. Premium Coaching

- **Offer lessons** if youâ€™re a top-rated player (1200+ ELO).
