## Special Moves

### Castling
A move that involves the king and either rook. It's the only move where two pieces move at once. The king moves two squares toward a rook, and that rook moves to the square the king crossed.

### En Passant
A special pawn capture that can occur when a pawn moves two squares from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn.

### Pawn Promotion
When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (usually a queen).

## Winning a Match

- **Checkmate**: The king is in check and cannot escape
- **Timeout**: Your opponent runs out of time
- **Resignation**: Your opponent resigns
