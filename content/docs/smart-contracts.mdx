## Core Contracts

1. **MatchContract**  
   - Stake handling (entry fees, payouts)  
   - Winner resolution via signed result  

2. **NFTRewardContract**  
   - Mints badge NFTs when events trigger  

3. **TokenContract**  
   - SPL token for platform rewards and staking  

## Security Measures

- **On-chain Timeouts**: Auto-resolve if a player is AFK  
- **Dispute Logic**: A third-party oracle can adjudicate contested matches  
- **Upgradability**: Managed via Anchor upgrades with multisig

## Deployment

- Deployed to **Devnet** for testing, then **Mainnet Beta**  
- Verified on Solana Explorer with public address links
