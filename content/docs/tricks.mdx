## 1. The Fork

- **Definition**: One piece attacks two (or more) enemy pieces simultaneously.  
- **Common Fork**: Knight in the center fork hitting king and rook.  

## 2. The Pin

- **Definition**: A piece is “pinned” when moving it would expose a more valuable piece behind it.  
- **Example**: Bishop pins a knight to the queen.

## 3. The Skewer

- **Definition**: Like a pin, but the more valuable piece is in front.  
- **Execution**: Attack the king or queen so that when it moves, a lesser piece is captured.

## 4. Back‐Rank Mate

- **Setup**: Your rook or queen delivers checkmate on the back rank (row 8) while the king is trapped by its own pawns.  

## 5. Decoy & Deflection

- **Decoy**: Lure an opponent’s piece onto a square where you can fork or pin it.  
- **Deflection**: Force a piece to leave its defensive post.

## 6. Pawn Structure Tricks

- **Isolated Pawns**: Use open files to attack isolated pawns.  
- **Passed Pawns**: Push passed pawns in endgames to distract the opponent.

## 7. Practice Methods

- **Tactics Trainer**: Solve daily puzzles in **Training Mode**.  
- **Blunder Analysis**: After each game, review mistakes on the Dashboard.  
- **Puzzle Rush**: Set a timer and see how many tactics you can solve in 3 minutes.
